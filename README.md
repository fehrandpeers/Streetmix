streetmix
=========

A fun, web-based street section builder, inspired by [Blockee][].

Streetmix has had a total development time of about five hours, so it is a:
* proof of concept
* work in progress
* pre-release alpha

We appreciate all the feedback and excitement we've received on our project so far, so we'll continue working on it here at Code for America Labs to get all the features we want to include! To join the conversation, please check out our [GitHub issue tracker][issues] or shoot an e-mail to our project team at streetmix@codeforamerica.org.

## <a name="about"></a>About

#### What are street sections?

A "section" is shortened way of saying "cross-section view", a type of 2D non-perspectival drawing commonly used in engineering and architecture to show what something looks like when you slice it in two pieces and then look at one slice head-on, to see how it is (or should be) assembled. Similarly, a street section is a cross section view of a street, showing the widths and placement of vehicle lanes, bike lanes, sidewalks, trees, street furniture or accessories (like benches or street lamps), as well as engineering information like how the road is sloped to facilitate drainage, or the locations of underground utilities. Although sections can be simplified line drawings, urban designers and landscape architects have created very colorful illustrative street sections, removing most of the engineering particulars to communicate how a street could be designed to feel safe, walkable or habitable.

#### Why does Streetmix exist?

In community meetings, one engagement activity is to create cut-out sheets of paper depicting different street components (like bike lanes, sidewalks, trees, etc.) and allow community members to reassemble them into their desired street structure. Planners and city officials can then take this feedback to determine a course of action for future plans. By creating an web-based version of this activity, planners can reach a wider audience than they could at meetings alone, and allow community members to share and edit each other's creations.

In addition, one of the goals of Streetmix is to be part of the national conversation around [Complete Streets][completestreets], or the Project for Public Spaces' [Rightsizing Streets Guide][rightsizing].

#### Why the name "Streetmix"?

"Streets" + "remix" :-)

#### How did this project start?

Streetmix was started as a [Code for America][cfa] hackathon project in January 2013.  The team comprised of 2013 Code for America fellows [Ans Bradford][ans], [Lou Huang][louh], [Katie Lewis][katie], [Ezra Spier][ahhrrr] and [Marcin Wichary][mwichary].
